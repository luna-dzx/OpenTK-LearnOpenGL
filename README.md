# OpenTK-LearnOpenGL
 My version/interpretation of all the LearnOpenGL tutorials, ending with a complete object oriented game engine
 
 Note: the first few projects of these had an implementation directly following the LearnOpenGL tutorials, followed
 by a second csproj for the object oriented implementation. This quickly became redundant when I needed to instead
 implement changes to the current game engine's project, so instead of this you can check the GitHub versions to
 see my implementation before and after a feature, if I wasn't too lazy with that specific project.
